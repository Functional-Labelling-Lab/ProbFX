## Benchmarks using Monad-Bayes
These benchmarks are equivalent to the others in probfx, fused-probfx and turing.

## Dependencies
Dependency resolution errors can occur on versions of base higher than `4.11`, hence `GHC 8.4.4` is recommended.

This is set using in the `bench.sh` script.

## How to run
```bash
cabal run --with-compiler=ghc-8.4.4
```
